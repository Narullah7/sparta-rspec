# RSPEC - Euler-problem 2

Using rspec in ruby we solve [Euler-problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) which states

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#### Running the tests

We tested for the following

* Checking wheather we got a array back featuring the correct fibonnaci sequence - this was tested because we needed to access each even number in the fibonacci sequence. this was very important in another test
* Checking upto a certain index in fibonnaci array, if we add the even numbers it should equal a value e.g. upto index 8 the even numbers in [1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55] should add upto 10
