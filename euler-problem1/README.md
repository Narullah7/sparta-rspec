# RSPEC - Euler-problem 1

Using rspec in ruby we solve [Euler-problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) which states

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#### Running the tests

We tested for the following

* Checking whether number we inserted was divisible by three and five
* Checking if the numbers below 10 and that were divisible by three or five added upto 23 - This was important test because it tested against the original problem statement.
* Checking if all the numbers below 1000 and that were divisible by five or three added upto the correct value - this gave the correct result.
